            From the moment our paths crossed, I knew my life would never be the same. You've become the rhythm in my silence, the warmth in my coldest days, and the dream I never want to wake from. Every shared smile, every gentle touch, and every heartfelt laugh we've exchanged has been a piece of our own fairytale. You've shown me love that is patient, kind, and endlessly inspiring. I cherish the quiet mornings, the late-night talks, and the simple moments in between that remind me how lucky I am to have you. As we look toward the future, I promise to walk with you hand in hand through every season of life. I want to grow old with you, share our dreams, weather storms, and celebrate every joy. Thank you for choosing me, loving me, and making this journey magical. This is only the beginning of our forever, and I can't wait to write the rest of our story—with you. 💕
